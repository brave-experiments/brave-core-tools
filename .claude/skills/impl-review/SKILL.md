# Implement Review Feedback

Checkout a PR's branch, implement the reviewer's feedback, run preflight checks, commit, and push.

## Arguments

- **`<pr-number>`** (required) — The PR number in brave/brave-core to implement review feedback for.

## Confirmation

Always ask for user confirmation before implementing changes, before committing/pushing, and before posting comments on GitHub.

## Working Directory Detection

Determine the brave source directory based on where the skill is invoked:

```bash
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
```

- **If running from within `src/brave`** (path contains `src/brave`): Use the current repo directory
  - `BRAVE_SRC="."`  (or the detected `src/brave` root)
- **If running from `brave-core-tools`** (path contains `brave-core-tools`): Use `../src/brave`
  - `BRAVE_SRC="../src/brave"`
- **Otherwise**: Try to detect by looking for characteristic files and fall back to asking the user

Resolve the path and use it consistently throughout.

## Steps

### 1. Parse Arguments

Extract the PR number from the arguments. It must be a numeric value. If no PR number is provided, ask the user for one.

### 2. Fetch PR Details

```bash
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo brave/brave-core --json headRefName,title,body,state,files,baseRefName
```

Extract:
- **Branch name** (`headRefName`) — the branch to checkout
- **Title** — for context
- **State** — must be `OPEN` (abort if closed/merged)
- **Base branch** — for understanding the diff context
- **Changed files** — to understand what the PR modifies

If the PR is not open, inform the user and stop.

### 3. Fetch Review Comments

Fetch review data from the PR:

```bash
gh api repos/brave/brave-core/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews --paginate
gh api repos/brave/brave-core/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate
gh api repos/brave/brave-core/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments --paginate
```

This provides:
- Reviews (approve/request changes/comment)
- Inline code review comments (with file paths and line numbers)
- Issue-level discussion comments

### 4. Analyze Review Feedback

Parse the review comments to understand what changes are requested:

1. **Identify actionable feedback** — Focus on explicit change requests from reviewers. Ignore:
   - Approvals without change requests
   - Informational comments that don't require action
   - Comments that have already been addressed (check commit timestamps vs comment timestamps)

2. **Categorize each requested change:**
   - Which file(s) need modification
   - What specific change is requested
   - Whether it affects production code, test code, or both

3. **Present the plan:**
   - How many review comments were found
   - Which are actionable vs already addressed
   - What changes you plan to make for each
   - Ask for user confirmation before proceeding

### 5. Checkout the Branch

```bash
cd $BRAVE_SRC
git fetch origin
git checkout <headRefName>
git pull origin <headRefName>
```

Ensure you're on the correct branch and up to date with the remote.

### 6. Implement Changes

**CRITICAL: Only make changes the reviewer explicitly asks for.**

- Do NOT make any additional changes — no "while I'm here" cleanups, no extra refactoring, no renaming things the reviewer didn't mention
- If the reviewer asks you to fix one thing, fix exactly that one thing and nothing else
- Every extra change risks introducing issues and makes the reviewer's job harder
- Read the full source files for context before making changes (don't just look at the diff)
- Apply the same coding standards as the rest of the codebase

### 7. Run Preflight Checks

Invoke the preflight skill to validate all changes:

```
/preflight
```

This runs: best practices check, format, gn_check, presubmit, build, and affected tests.

If preflight fails:
- Fix the issues it identifies
- Re-run preflight until it passes
- All fixes should still be scoped to the review feedback (don't fix unrelated issues)

### 8. Commit and Push

Before committing, show the user a summary of all changes (files modified, diff stats) and ask for confirmation. If the user rejects, stop without committing.

**ALWAYS create a NEW separate commit** — never amend existing commits.

```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Address review: <brief description of changes>
EOF
)"
git push
```

Commit message guidelines:
- Start with "Address review:" prefix
- Briefly describe what feedback was addressed
- Keep under 72 characters for subject line
- **DO NOT** include any `Co-Authored-By` line
- **DO NOT** use `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign` flags

If multiple logical units of review feedback were addressed, consider separate commits for each.

### 9. Post PR Comment

Show the draft comment to the user and ask for confirmation before posting. If the user rejects, skip posting.

Post a summary comment on the PR:

```bash
gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --repo brave/brave-core --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Fixed: <description of what was changed>

<For each review point addressed, briefly note what was done>
EOF
)"
```

### 10. Report Summary

Output a summary to the user:
- PR number and title
- Number of review comments addressed
- What changes were made
- Preflight result (pass/fail)
- Commit SHA
- Link to the PR

## Important Rules

1. **Minimal changes** — Only implement what reviewers explicitly ask for
3. **New commits only** — Never amend; separate commits let reviewers track what changed
4. **No attribution** — No `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits
5. **User confirmation** — Present the plan before implementing, confirm before committing, confirm before posting comments
6. **Preflight required** — All changes must pass preflight before pushing

---

## Example Usage

```
/impl-review 12345
```
Asks for confirmation before implementing, committing, and posting.
