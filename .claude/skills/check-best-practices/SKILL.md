# Best Practices Check

Systematically audit the current branch's changes against every applicable best practice. This produces a per-document report showing which practices were checked, which violations were found, and which practices are not applicable to the current changes.

---

## Step 1: Detect Working Directory

Determine the brave source directory:

```bash
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
```

- **If within `src/brave`**: `BRAVE_SRC="."`, `CHROMIUM_SRC="../../"`
- **If within `brave-core-tools`**: `BRAVE_SRC="../src/brave"`, `CHROMIUM_SRC="../src"`
- **Otherwise**: Look for characteristic files to detect, or ask the user

---

## Step 2: Determine Base Branch

Detect the base branch in this order:

1. **Check for an existing PR**:
   ```bash
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git -C $BRAVE_SRC branch --show-current)
   PR_BASE=$(gh pr view "$CURRENT_BRANCH" --repo brave/brave-core \
     --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName' 2>/dev/null) || true
   ```

2. **Check the upstream tracking branch**:
   ```bash
   TRACKING=$(git -C $BRAVE_SRC rev-parse --abbrev-ref \
     "$CURRENT_BRANCH@{upstream}" 2>/dev/null) || true
   ```

3. **Fall back to `master`**

Report the detected base branch at the start.

---

## Step 3: Gather the Diff

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git -C $BRAVE_SRC merge-base HEAD $BASE_BRANCH)

# All committed changes on this branch since diverging from base
git -C $BRAVE_SRC diff $MERGE_BASE..HEAD

# Uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged)
git -C $BRAVE_SRC diff HEAD

# List of changed files
git -C $BRAVE_SRC diff --name-only $MERGE_BASE..HEAD
git -C $BRAVE_SRC diff --name-only HEAD
```

Combine committed + uncommitted changes into the full diff to audit.

---

## Step 4: Classify Changed Files

Categorize every changed file to determine which best practices documents apply:

| File Pattern | Category | Best Practices Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `*.cc`, `*.h`, `*.mm` | C++ code | `coding-standards.md`, `coding-standards-memory.md`, `coding-standards-apis.md` |
| `*_browsertest*`, `*_unittest*`, `*test*.cc` | C++ tests | `testing-async.md`, `testing-isolation.md` |
| `*browsertest*` with JS eval | JS in tests | `testing-javascript.md` |
| `*browsertest*` with navigation | Navigation tests | `testing-navigation.md` |
| `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx` | Front-end | `frontend.md` |
| `*.java`, `*.kt`, `android/` paths | Android | `android.md` |
| `*.swift`, `ios/` paths | iOS | `ios.md` |
| `BUILD.gn`, `*.gni`, `DEPS` | Build system | `build-system.md` |
| `chromium_src/**` | chromium_src overrides | `chromium-src-overrides.md` |
| `*.patch`, `patches/` paths | Patches | `patches.md` |
| `*/res/drawable/*`, `*/res/values/*`, `components/vector_icons/`, `*.icon`, `*.svg` | Nala/icons | `nala.md` |
| Architecture/service files | Architecture | `architecture.md` |
| `*.md`, comments, docs | Documentation | `documentation.md` |

A file can match multiple categories (e.g., a `_browsertest.cc` is both C++ and test code).

**Always include `coding-standards.md` if any C++ files are changed**, since it covers universal C++ rules.

---

## Step 5: Systematic Best Practices Audit

For each applicable best practices document, perform a focused audit:

### Process for Each Document

1. **Read the full document** from `./brave-core-tools/docs/best-practices/<doc>.md`
2. **Read the changed files in full** to understand context (not just the diff)
3. **Check each practice in the document against the diff**, one by one
4. **Classify each practice** for this diff as:
   - **VIOLATION**: The diff introduces code that violates this practice
   - **PASS**: The diff includes code relevant to this practice and follows it correctly
   - **N/A**: This practice doesn't apply to any code in the diff

**Important:**
- Only flag VIOLATION for code that is **newly introduced or modified** in the diff. Don't flag pre-existing code that wasn't touched.
- Read surrounding code context to avoid false positives. A pattern that looks wrong in isolation may be correct in context.
- Do not suggest renaming imported symbols (functions, classes, variables) that are defined outside the diff's changed files. The author cannot rename them without modifying the upstream module, which is out of scope.
- For each violation, cite the specific practice title, the file and line, and what should change.

### Document Audit Order

Audit documents in this order (most impactful first):

1. **`coding-standards.md`** — if any C++ files changed
2. **`coding-standards-memory.md`** — if any C++ files changed
3. **`coding-standards-apis.md`** — if any C++ files changed
4. **`testing-async.md`** — if any test files changed
5. **`testing-isolation.md`** — if any test files changed
6. **`testing-javascript.md`** — if tests use JS evaluation
7. **`testing-navigation.md`** — if tests involve navigation
8. **`architecture.md`** — if service/component architecture changed
9. **`chromium-src-overrides.md`** — if chromium_src files changed
10. **`build-system.md`** — if BUILD.gn/gni/DEPS files changed
11. **`frontend.md`** — if TypeScript/React files changed
12. **`android.md`** — if Java/Kotlin or android/ path files changed
13. **`ios.md`** — if Swift or ios/ path files changed
14. **`patches.md`** — if .patch files or patches/ path files changed
15. **`nala.md`** — if icon/drawable/vector icon files changed
16. **`documentation.md`** — if documentation or comments changed

**Skip documents entirely if no changed files fall into their category.** Report which documents were skipped and why.

## Step 6: Check the Quick Checklist

After the per-document audit, also check the quick checklist from `BEST-PRACTICES.md` if any async test code was changed:

- [ ] No `RunLoop::RunUntilIdle()` usage
- [ ] No `EvalJs()` or `ExecJs()` inside `RunUntil()` lambdas
- [ ] Using manual polling loops for JavaScript conditions
- [ ] Using `base::test::RunUntil()` only for C++ conditions
- [ ] Waiting for specific completion signals, not arbitrary timeouts
- [ ] Using isolated worlds (`ISOLATED_WORLD_ID_BRAVE_INTERNAL`) for test JS
- [ ] Per-resource expected values for HTTP request testing
- [ ] Large throttle windows for throttle behavior tests
- [ ] Proper observers for same-document navigation
- [ ] Testing public APIs, not implementation details
- [ ] Searched Chromium codebase for similar patterns
- [ ] Included Chromium code references in comments when following patterns
- [ ] Prefer event-driven JS (MutationObserver) over C++ polling for DOM changes

## Step 7: Generate Report

```markdown
# Best Practices Audit: <branch-name>

## Overview
- **Branch**: <branch-name>
- **Base branch**: <base-branch> (detection method: PR / tracking / default)
- **Files changed**: <count>
- **Documents audited**: <count> of 16
- **Documents skipped**: <count> (not applicable)

## Violations Found

### <violation-count> Violation(s)

For each violation:

#### [<doc-name>] <practice-title>
- **File**: `path/to/file.cc:<line>`
- **Practice**: <brief description of the practice>
- **Issue**: <what the code does wrong>
- **Fix**: <what should be done instead, with code example if helpful>

## Per-Document Results

### <doc-name> — <VIOLATIONS_FOUND | ALL_PASS | SKIPPED>

<If audited, list practices checked with their status:>
- PASS: <practice title> — <brief note on what was checked>
- VIOLATION: <practice title> — see Violations section
- N/A: <practice title>

<If skipped:>
Skipped — no <category> files in the diff.

## Summary

**Result**: <PASS (no violations) | FAIL (<N> violations found)>

<If violations found:>
<N> violation(s) across <M> best practices document(s). Fix the violations listed above before proceeding.

<If no violations:>
All applicable best practices checked. No violations found in the branch changes.
```

## Important Guidelines

### Accuracy Over Speed
- **Read changed files in full** — don't just rely on the diff. Context matters.
- **Don't flag false positives** — if unsure whether something is a violation, read more context. A false positive wastes developer time.
- **Only flag new/modified code** — pre-existing violations in untouched code are out of scope.
- **Only flag violations documented in the best practices.** Do not make claims based on general knowledge or assumptions. If the best practices docs don't contain a rule about something, don't flag it — even if you believe it to be true. Hallucinated rules (e.g., claiming an API is "deprecated" when no doc says so) erode trust.
- **Before each comment, verify your claims by reading relevant source code in `src/brave/` and `src/`.** Do not assert that an API is deprecated, a pattern is wrong, or a function should be replaced without first checking the actual codebase. Look at how the API/pattern is used elsewhere in the codebase, read header files and upstream Chromium code to confirm your understanding. Ground every comment in what the code actually says.

### Be Specific and Actionable
- Every violation must include file, line, and a concrete fix suggestion.
- Reference the specific best practice by its title from the document.
- Include code examples when the fix isn't obvious.

### Don't Over-Report
- **N/A practices don't need individual listings** in the summary unless verbose output is requested. Group them as a count.
- Focus the report on violations and notable passes.
- Keep the report scannable — developers should be able to find violations quickly.
