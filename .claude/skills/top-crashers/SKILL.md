# Top Crashers

Query Brave's Backtrace crash reporting instance for top crashers. Returns developer-actionable data including crash signatures, stack traces, platform/version breakdowns, channel mapping, code origin classification, and triage URLs.

**PII-safe**: Only aggregate data is output. Use the triage URLs for full crash details.

---

## When to Use

- **Investigating stability regressions** after a release
- **Prioritizing crash fixes** — which crashes affect the most users
- **Detecting new crashers** introduced by recent changes
- **Filing crash bugs** — the output includes suggested issue titles and labels
- **During development** — checking if your area of code has top crashers

---

## Environment Requirements

The `BACKTRACE_API_KEY` environment variable must be set with a token that has `query:post` capability. The `BACKTRACE_PROJECT` environment variable should also be set (or pass `--project` as an argument).

If not set, inform the user:
```
BACKTRACE_API_KEY must be set. Create a token with query:post capability in Backtrace project settings.
BACKTRACE_PROJECT should be set to the Backtrace project name (or pass --project).
```

---

## The Job

When invoked, run the top-crashers script and present the results to the user.

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Map the user's request to script arguments:

| User says | Script flags |
|-----------|-------------|
| "top crashers" (no args) | `--days 7 --limit 25` |
| "top 10 crashers" | `--limit 10` |
| "crashers on Windows" | `--platform Windows` |
| "crashers on Mac" | `--platform Darwin` |
| "crashers on Linux" | `--platform Linux` |
| "crashers on Android" | `--platform Android` |
| "crashers in version 1.73" | `--version 1.73.` |
| "new crashers" or "crash regressions" | `--new-only` |
| "compare crashers" or "what's regressing" | `--compare 2` |
| "crashers last 30 days" | `--days 30` |
| "crashers since 2025-02-01" | `--since 2025-02-01` |
| "worst crashers" | `--order count` (default) |
| "most recent crashers" | `--order last-seen` |
| "actual crashes" or "real crashes" | `--crashes-only` |
| "crashes on nightly" or "nightly crashers" | `--channels nightly` |
| "crashes on nightly and beta" | `--channels nightly,beta` |
| "release crashes" | `--channels release` |
| "brave code crashes" or "our crashes" | `--brave-only` |
| "what should we fix" or "actionable crashes" | `--crashes-only --channels nightly` |

If the user provides explicit flags (e.g., `/top-crashers --compare 3 --platform Windows`), pass them through directly.

### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
python3 ./brave-core-tools/scripts/top-crashers.py --project "$BACKTRACE_PROJECT" --format json [parsed flags]
```

Always use `--format json` when running programmatically so you can parse and present the results. For a quick human-readable dump, use `--format markdown` instead.

### Step 3: Present Results

After running the script, present the results to the user in a clear format:

1. **Summary header**: "Found N crash groups in the last M days"
2. **For each crasher** (in order):
   - Rank, suggested title, and badges:
     - **[CRASH]** or **[DUMP_WITHOUT_CRASHING]** — whether this is an actual crash or DumpWithoutCrashing. DumpWithoutCrashing is a non-fatal diagnostic that does NOT affect users.
     - **[BRAVE]**, **[CHROMIUM]**, or **[MIXED]** — whether the crashing code is in Brave's codebase (`src/brave`) or upstream Chromium (`src/`). Only Brave code crashes are directly fixable by the Brave team.
     - **[NEW]**, **[RISING]** — regression indicators
   - Crash count and rate (crashes/day)
   - **Channel breakdown** — which channels are affected (Nightly, Beta, Release, Older). Highlight whether the crash affects **current Nightly** since that represents the latest master code.
   - Top platform with % share
   - Top version with % share (displayed as "Brave X.Y.Z (Cr N)")
   - Recency (when last seen)
   - Callstack (top frames)
   - Triage URL for full details
3. **If compare mode**: Highlight NEW and RISING crashers prominently

**Presentation priorities:**
- Always clearly distinguish actual crashes from DumpWithoutCrashing
- Highlight crashes affecting Nightly (current master) — these are the most actionable
- Note code origin — crashes in Brave code are directly fixable
- When prioritizing what to fix, recommend focusing on: actual crashes (not dumps) that affect Nightly (current code) in Brave code

### GitHub Formatting Rules

When mentioning a crasher's rank in GitHub issues, PR descriptions, or comments, **never** use `#N` syntax (e.g., `#8`). GitHub automatically converts `#N` into a link to issue or PR number N, which is misleading.

- **Bad:** "This is the #8 crasher this week" — GitHub links to issue/PR 8
- **Good:** "This is the No. 8 crasher this week", "This is crasher rank 8", "the 8th top crasher"

This applies to issue titles, bodies, PR descriptions, and comments — anywhere GitHub renders markdown.

### Step 4: Offer Follow-Up Actions

After presenting results, suggest relevant follow-up actions:

- "Want me to look into any of these crashes in more detail?"
- "I can filter by a specific platform or version"
- "I can check if any of these are regressions with `--compare`"
- "I can show only actual crashes with `--crashes-only`"
- "I can filter by channel with `--channels nightly`, `--channels nightly,beta`, etc."
- "I can show only Brave code crashes with `--brave-only`"
- "I can draft GitHub issues for the top crashers"

## Output Fields Per Crash Group

Each crash group includes these **allowlisted fields only** (PII-safe):

- **fingerprint** — SHA256 group ID (safe to reference in issues)
- **count** / **crashes_per_day** — Occurrence counts
- **classifier** — Crash signal (e.g. dump, invalid-access, breakpoint, abort)
- **crash_type** — `"crash"` (actual user-impacting) or `"dump"` (DumpWithoutCrashing diagnostic)
- **code_origin** — `"brave"` (Brave-specific code), `"chromium"` (upstream), or `"mixed"`
- **top_frame** — First meaningful crashing function
- **signature** — Combined `TopFrame (Classifier) on Platform Version`
- **callstack** — Top N sanitized stack frames
- **top_platform** / **platform_pct** — Most affected platform + % share
- **top_version** / **version_pct** — Most affected version + % share
- **channel_breakdown** — `{"nightly": N, "beta": N, "release": N, "older": N}`
- **top_channel** — Channel with most crashes
- **affects_nightly** — Whether this crash appears on current Nightly
- **first_seen** / **last_seen** / **recency** — Timestamps
- **is_new** — Whether first seen within the lookback window
- **triage_url** — Link to Backtrace UI for full details
- **suggested_title** — Ready-to-use issue title
- **labels** — Suggested issue labels

In compare mode, also:
- **regression_badge** — NEW, RISING, FALLING, or STABLE
- **change_factor** — Ratio of recent vs baseline count
- **baseline_count** — Count from the baseline period

---

## Version Format

Brave versions follow the format `CHROMIUM_MAJOR.BRAVE_MAJOR.BRAVE_MINOR.BRAVE_PATCH`:
- `145.1.87.42` = Brave 1.87.42 on Chromium 145
- Channel mapping is fetched from the Brave Release Schedule wiki at runtime

---

## Limitations

- Requires `BACKTRACE_API_KEY` with `query:post` capability
- Stack frames are sanitized (paths stripped, truncated at 200 chars)
- Histograms show top 5 values; use triage URL for full breakdown
- Compare mode uses a simple 2x threshold for RISING detection
- Code origin detection greps for crashing symbols in `src/brave` when the directory is found, with namespace heuristic fallback
- Channel versions are fetched from the wiki with hardcoded fallback defaults
