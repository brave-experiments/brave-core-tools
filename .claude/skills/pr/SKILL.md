# Create Pull Request

Create a pull request for the current branch using `gh`.

## Current State

- Changed files: !`git diff master...HEAD --stat`

## Steps

- Check if the branch is associated with a GitHub issue (look at branch name, commit messages, or recent context for an issue number).

### 2. Push the branch
Run `git push -u origin HEAD`.

### 3. Create the PR
Use `gh pr create` with:
- **Title:** Short, direct summary of the change (under 70 chars).

Keep the description concise. Just state what was done.
